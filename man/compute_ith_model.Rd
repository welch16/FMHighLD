\title{Computes the i-th mixture model for fitting the FM-HighLD model}
\usage{
compute_ith_model(i, formula, data, gamma, multi_trait = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{i}{a numeric index, usually i = 2 only that correspond to the causal
variants, but the model is performed for a list in case more models are
being fitted for the locus}

\item{formula}{formula used for fitting the underlying linear model used by
FM-HighLD}

\item{data}{`data.frame` used for the FM-HighLD model}

\item{gamma}{a `Matrix::Matrix` with the conditional probabilities of the
variants being in each model}

\item{multi_trait}{a logical indicator determining if the model is for
multi_trait or single-trait fine-mapping}
}
